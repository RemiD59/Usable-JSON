I decided to make my first track a hard one because of the Dr Phunk remixes for Hardwell's Run Wild and Apollo, trully love these ones and they still are the best hardstyle remixes I've ever heard, it really inspired me late 2016.",

The first reason is that this is my very first collab ever, I worked with Vee, an australian singer I met on Reddit, we should have made a second track together but we discontinued it because of her complex schedule. The second reason, the most important one, is that I wrote the song by myself and I dedicated it to a girl I used to love at that time. This is for sure the track I was the most involved in. I worked two or three months straight on this even if it might not sound amazing right now, I was still learning how to make, mix and master music.",

KSHMR is a true source of inspiration, there's him, Hardwell, David Guetta and Martin Garrix, there you have my favorite crew of all time. This track was added to the KSHMR Journey playlist on Spotify and despite of this, this is not the most aired track of mine on Spotify 'cause it was overtaken by another one called Make The Ground Shake with 24k listeners, it was released before Turn It Up. This is also the first time I put a track out thanks to a label with whom I signed a contract on real paper (I did appear on tiny labels before but this was more of community channels than real labels).",

    "description": "My remix of Voices by KSHMR, Brooks and TZAR is by far the biggest success I had if we compare it with all my previous releases. I made it in order to enter an official remix contest organized by Spinnin' Records, I can't remember well my exact placement in the chart but it was something like 100-200 among +1000 entries so that's not bad at all, the chart was based on a voting system, still proud of it. The funny thing is that most of the traffic that comes over my YouTube channel today still come from this remix.",
